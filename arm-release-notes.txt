arm tested on angstrom for omap4430-panda.
Linux tai 2.6.35.3+ #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Apr 2 17:53:45 CEST 2011 armv7l GNU/Linux

reqirements:

- Install M4 (m4-1.4.16), GNU bison (bison-2.5), GNU flex (flex-2.5.35) from
  source.  Versions provided in distro are broken.

- Replace busybox as much as possible.  It provides broken UNIX commands.

- MUST replace /bin/sh -> busybox with /bin/sh /bin/bash to get test scripts
  to work since busybox shell does not treat environment variables correctly.

- CLETE does not work because I need to add gen_operators compiled for ARM
