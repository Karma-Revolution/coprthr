***********************
*** General information

The standard compute layer library (libstdcl) provides a simple interface to
the OpenCL API for parallel programming of heterogeneous platforms with
co-processor devices.  libstdcl is designed to support the most typical 
use-cases in a style inspired by familiar and traditional UNIX APIs for C
programming.  The libstdcl library implemented by Brown Deer Technology is
freely available and distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
version 3 (LGPLv3).

The libstdcl library is NOT an implementation of OpenCL and requires an OpenCL
implementation to be installed in order to work.


*****************************
*** Recent Changes 

- (20091117) added platform_id selection by name, optionally set by 
  environment variable, with "ATI" as default


******************
*** Tested systems

libstdcl has been tested on the foillowing operating systems and hardware:

- openSUSE 11.1 Linux (32bit and 64bit)
- ATI Radeon HD 4850, 4870, 5870

If you are able to get libstdcl to work on other systems, please, let us
know so we can expand the list of tested systems.  


****************
*** Known issues

- Most important issue is that this is a BETA release and the software
  is under active development.  If something is not working, check back
  for an update, and report any bugs/issues so we can get them into the
  development.

- clld support for binary CL programs is not completed since this is a work
  in progress within underlying OpenCL implementations.  source only support.

- The ELF sections created by clld are only partly utilized at this time.

- cltrace does not support tracing libstdcl calls yet. This will be added soon.

- clmattach/clmdetach are not yet implemented despite the man page.

- clmsync "AUTO" is not yet implemented.

- Finally, this list is not exhaustive.  There are surely other bugs and
  issues that will be uncovered with more testing.


***************************
*** Software using libstdcl

- BDT N-Body code (bdt_nbody-0.6.3)
- BDT Seismic3D code (bdt_seismic3d-0.4.3)
- BDT tutorial on N-Body code also uses libstdcl to simplify the host code

If you use libstdcl, please, let us know so we can expand this initial list.
