.SH DESCRIPTION
clwait() is used to block on the completion of one or more outstanding 
events for device number \fIdevnum\fP within a CL context.  
The type of events are specificed by selecting one or more event lists as 
described below.
.PP
One or more event lists may be selected using a combination of the following
flags:
.TP
.B CL_KERNEL_EVENT
Block on events in the ordered kernel event list.
.TP
.B CL_MEM_EVENT
Block on events in the ordered memory event list.
.PP
Note that if both kernel and memory event lists are specified, the kernel
event list has first priority.  
Specifically, clwait() will first block on all outstanding kernel events and 
subsequently block on all outstanding memory events.
.PP
The bahavior of clwait() can be controlled using the following flags:
.TP
.B CL_EVENT_RELEASE
Force clwait() to release all events on upon completion for all events on
which it blocks.
If this flag is not used the programmer is responsible for releasing the 
returned event using clReleaseEvent().
.SH RETURN VALUE
On error clwait() will return (cl_event)(-1) and errno is set appropriately.
