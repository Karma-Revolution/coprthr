The standard compute layer library (libstdcl) provides a simple interface to

co-processor devices.  libstdcl is designed to support the most typical 
use-cases in a style inspired by familiar and traditional UNIX APIs for C
programming.  The libstdcl library implemented by Brown Deer Technology is
freely available and distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
version 3 (LGPLv3).

The libstdcl library is NOT an implementation of OpenCL and requires an OpenCL
implementation to be installed in order to work.
