<h1 id="support-and-requirements"><a href="#support-and-requirements"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Support and Requirements</a></h1>
<p>Full SDK support is provided for Linux, Ubuntu, and FreeBSD operating systems. Additionally, the STDCL™ API is supported for Windows 7. Supported hardware includes AMD and Nvidia GPUs, Intel and AMD x86 multicore CPUs, ARM multicore CPUs, and Epiphany multicore processors. The COPRTHR SDK leverages vendor OpenCL GPU implementations and also provides OpenCL implementions for multicore processors to provide truly cross-vendor/cross-device support for heterogeneous computing platforms.</p>

<p>Please take note that libelf 1.x branch found on most Linux distributions is <em>not a valid substitute</em> for libelf-0.8.13 since they lack the required features and exhibit undocumented broken behavior.</p>

<h1 id="important-notes"><a href="#important-notes"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Important Notes</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p>On Windows 7 platforms the function init_stdcl() must be called to initialize the STDCL API. This call is unnecessary for Linux and FreeBSD, but there is no harm in including it since it will default to an empty macro.</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;debug libraries&quot; have been eliminated with the new debug and reporting structure.</p></li>
<li><p>The version of the boost library (1.47.0) used here for development unfortunately has a very minor bug that prevents it from working with MSVS 2010. A fix to the boost package is provided in this release. Just follow the instructions under the <code>msvs2010/boost_1_47_0-multi_array-iterator-fix/</code> directory. (All you need to do is copy over a replacement for iterator.hpp.)</p></li>
<li><p>Some example kernels include the stdcl.h header. Including this header for OpenCL kernels allows the use of alternate syntax that avoids breaking C. Programmers are encouraged to begin this practice now. A future release will formalize syntax corrections to OpenCL to produce a C compliant language for programming thread functions (kernels). The alternate syntax will be completely backward compatable with OpenCL.</p></li>
<li><p>When installing COPRTHR SDK on Linux Angstrom for ARM, be aware of the following required changes to the standard Linux Angstrom distribution. All busybox substitutes for UNIX commands that are encountered should be replaced with real implementations that actually work. Specifically, GNU coreutils and binutils should be installed and used to provide relevant commands. The command /usr/bin/time should be replaced with a command that works properly to execute the standard tests that come with COPRTHR. The standard shell /bin/sh should be replaced with a real implementation of bash which actually works. Finally, you must also re-install bison-2.5, flex-2.5.35, and m4-1.4.16 using the GNU distributions of these packages since the installed version of bison is broken.</p></li>

<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions"><a href="#frequently-asked-questions"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Frequently Asked Questions</a></h1>
<p>Below are answers to frequently asked questions regarding COPRTHR SDK and STDCL.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does STDCL require the BDT OpenCL run-time?</p>
<p>No. The basic installation of libstdcl.so will work with any compliant OpenCL installation including the latest implementations from AMD, Nvidia and Intel.</p></li>
<li><p>Will using STDCL reduce performance or limit access to OpenCL functionality?</p>
<p>No. STDCL is implemented as a very light-weight interface, does not restrict access to direct OpenCL and fully supports asynchronous operations across multiple devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Are STDCL calls simply wrappers for OpenCL calls?</p>
<p>No. There is a bit more to the interface than wrapping OpenCL calls. For the curious, take a look at the source code.</p></li>
</ul>
