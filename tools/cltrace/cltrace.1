.SH "NAME"
cltrace \- trace computer layer (CL) calls 
.SH SYNOPSIS
cltrace [-ctT]  [-0] [-1] [-2]
        [--cal|--no-cal] [--opencl|--no-opencl] [--stdcl|--no-stdcl]
        command [arg...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
cltrace can be used to trace compute layer (CL) calls including stdcl calls,
OpenCL calls, and low-level implementation calls such as the ATI CAL layer.
Tracing of the following libraries are currently supported:
.TP 10
.IR API
.IR level
.IR library
.TP
ATI/CAL
0	
libaticalrt.so,libaticalcl.so
.TP
OpenCL 
1	
libopenCl.so
.TP
libstdcl 
2	
libstdcl.so
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
.RI \-c 
Count time, number of calls, and errors for each call that is traced
and report a summary upon program exit.  This option supresses the printing
of the actual trace output for each call.
.TP
.RI \-t
Prefix each line of the trace output with a timestamp of the form sec:usec 
based on a call to the function gettimeofday().
.TP
.RI \-T
Add to each line of the trace output the time spent in each call 
measured in seconds.
.TP
.RI \-0
Trace level 0 CL calls that correspond to the OpenCL implementaion layers.
.TP
.RI \-1
Trace level 1 CL calls that correspond to the OpenCL standard API.
.TP
.RI \-2
Trace level 2 CL calls that corresond to interfaces to the OpenCL API.
.TP
\-\-cal, \-0
Trace ATI/CAL calls that correspond to the OpenCL implementaion layers.
.TP
\-\-opencl, \-1
Trace OpenCL calls that correspond to the OpenCL standard API.
.TP
\-\-stdcl, \-2
Trace libstdcl calls that corresond to an interface to the OpenCL API.
.TP
\-\-no\-cal
Do not 
trace ATI/CAL calls that correspond to the OpenCL implementaion layers.
.TP
\-\-no\-opencl
Do not
trace OpenCL calls that correspond to the OpenCL standard API.
.TP
\-\-no\-stdcl
Do not
trace libstdcl calls that corresond to an interface to the OpenCL API.
