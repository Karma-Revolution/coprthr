BEFORE you configure with --enable-libocl you MUST follow these instructions 
for installing llvm-ex:

(1) build llvm-2.6 from source 
		make; sudo make install

(2) copy this directory (where you find the INSTRUCTIUONS you are reading) 
    into the llvm tools/ directory

(3) edit the llvm tools/Makefile to add llvm-ex to the variable assignment 
    for PARALLEL_DIRS

(4) rebuild llvm and make sure you install it again,
		make; sudo make install

This should build and install llvm-ex 

In order to verify that this worked, open a new xterm and type which llvm-ex
and you should find the program.

If this does not work, send a note to support@browndeertechnology.com
