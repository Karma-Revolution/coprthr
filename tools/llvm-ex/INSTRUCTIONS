BEFORE using coprthr, follow these instructions for installing llvm-ex:

(1) copy this directory into the tools/ directory of your llvm-2.6 installation
(2) in tools/Makefile add llvm-ex to the variable assignment for PARALLEL_DIRS
(3) cd to the root directory for llvm and type
		make; sudo make install

This should build and install llvm-ex 

In order to verify that this worked, open a new xterm and type which llvm-ex
and you should find the program.

If this does not work, send a note to support@browndeertechnology.com
